MySessionHandler extends SessionHandler and allows you to modify the session functions.
Could be used to move session data to a db, or maybe perform some extra functions on it before or after saving etc.

Run session-demo (pref. with cli server running) to test it out, at present it just echos a message on top of the normal function.
